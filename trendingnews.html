    	<p ><em>All significant smartphone launches have now passed and as we approach the end of the year, the ten best shake out after more extended usage of each. All ten phones are excellent and certain aspects make each a possible contender for the top spot.</em></p>

        </a>
    		<p>The Galaxy Note 9 is the best phone for business and continues to be my favorite phone of 2018.
    		 I've been using one now for several months and despite trying out some great new phones like
    		 the iPhone XS Max and Google Pixel 3 XL, none of these can replace the Note 9 and everything 
    		 Samsung includes in this stunning device.
    		 This is especially true for use in the enterprise space.</p>
             
             <p>The Galaxy Note 9 improves upon the Note 8 with a Bluetooth S Pen, more internal capacity and RAM,             
             a massive 4,000 mAh battery, better dual rear cameras with some software intelligence,
             enhanced audio capability, and new placement of the rear fingerprint scanner.</p>

             <div class="b"><h3 class="titujt">2.HUAWEI MATE 20 PRO</h3></div>

             </a>
             <p>Huawei recently announced the Mate 20 Pro and it brings together all of the greatness of Huawei 
             into a single device that is tough to beat. The Mate 20 Pro includes the first Android 7nm process 
             chipset with the Kirin 980 (Apple's A12 Bionic also uses the 7nm process), two Neural Processing Units,
             a fourth-generation image signal processor, and a LTE Cat.21 modem.</p>
    	     
    	     <p>The triple rear camera capability from the Huawei P20 Pro is brought to the Mate 20 Pro, 
    	     	but in a different central two-by-two arrangement with one change made to one of the three lenses.
    	       The three rear cameras have 40MP, 20MP, and 8MP resolution with a 24MP front-facing shooter 
    	       and artificial intelligence to help you capture great shots.
    	       The monochrome lens has been replaced with a wide-angle lens so that you now have telephoto,
    	        wide-angle, and standard camera functionality.</p></div>

    	        
    	        <div class="c"><h3 class="titujt">3.GOOGLE PIXEL 3 XL AND PIXEL 3 </p></h3></div>

            </a>
    	        <p>While the Galaxy Note 9 offers just about everything you want, software updates are not its specialty.
    	         If you want an Android phone that will always have the latest firmware and security updates, 
    	         while also offering a fairly stock experience, then nothing beats the new Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL.
    	         These two phones are the exact same except for the overall size and battery capacity.</p>
    	         
    	         <p>The Google Pixel 3 XL has a large 6.3-inch 18:9 display, Snapdragon 845 processor, 4GB of RAM,
    	          64GB and 128GB integrated storage, single rear 12.2 megapixel camera, dual front-facing cameras,
    	           IP68 dust and water resistance, a 3430 mAh battery, and dual front stereo speakers.
    	            The smaller Pixel 3 has a 5.5 inch display and smaller 2,915 mAh battery while the 
    	           rest of the specs are the same as the XL model. Thankfully, wireless charging is included this year,
    	           along with a set of wired Pixel Buds in the retail package.</p>

    	           <p>Apple pushed the entry-level price of a flagship up to $1,000 last year with the iPhone X 
    	           and raised the bar again this year with the most expensive flagship available in the iPhone XS Max. 
    	           ZDNet's Jason Cipriani awarded the iPhone XS Max an impressive near-perfect score of 9.6/10 so I'm pretty 
    	           sure Jason would give the top spot to this phone</p>
    	         
    	           <p>I ordered my own iPhone XS Max to replace my iPhone X, using the T-Mobile Jump On Demand program, 
    	           but after two weeks I sent it back as I found the small size of the iPhone X was one of the primary 
    	           reasons it still earned a place in my pocket.</p>
    	           <p>The Apple iPhone XS Max has been shown to best all other phones in benchmarking testing and the Apple A12 Bionic chipset certainly blazes new trails. It has a fabulous OLED screen, good sized battery, and new camera software to make it a very compelling flagship.</p>

                   </a>
                   <p>OnePlus launched the new OnePlus 6T at the end of October and for the first time ever it
                    launched on a US wireless carrier. I picked up my Mirror Black model at a local T-Mobile store,
                     after visiting several stores that were sold out, and took advantage of the $300 launch trade-in option.</p>
                   
                   <p>OnePlus earns a top five spot on my list because of the high end specifications, reasonable 
                   price that is hundreds less than other flagships, extremely responsive performance, and use of new technology.</p>
                   
                   <p>If I had an affordable smartphone list, then the OnePlus 6T would be number one
                    with prices ranging from $549 to $629. The lowest cost one still has 6GB of RAM and
                     128GB of storage while the $629 model has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. 
                    You will not find another phone with these great specs for these prices.</p>

                    <p>While US consumers will have to resort to eBay to pick one up, the Huawei P20 Pro 
                    remains one of the most exciting phones of 2018, even with its new cousin just launching
                     in the form of the Mate 20 Pro.</p>

                    <p>The unique triple camera design with 68 megapixels worth of shooting power 
                    should help you take some fantastic shots with a low light mode that beats out
                     all the other smartphones available today.</p>

                    <p>Huawei has been including massive capacity batteries in its flagships and the P20
                     Pro is no exception with 4,000 mAh that is sure to get you through at least one full,
                      busy day. It has a large 6.1 inch OLED with a notch you can show or hide, a powerful
                       Kirin 970 processor with integrated AI, IP67 dust and water resistance, and more.</p>

                   </a>
                     <p>This year Apple announced three new phones with one releasing a month after the other two.
                      I traded in the iPhone XS Max for an iPhone XR and overall I am quite happy with the device
                       and saving $350 over the iPhone XS Max.</p>

                      <p>The Apple iPhone XR differs from the XS/XS Max with a LED screen instead of OLED, lower resolution, 
                      no 3D Touch support (does anyone even care about this?), a single rear camera, and a 6.1 inch display 
                      that fits in between these other two new phones. It has the same Apple A12 Bionic processor, same camera
                      software and hardware as the 12MP prime camera, and other enhanced Apple features like face unlock.
                      The iPhone XR has a larger capacity battery than the iPhone XS and a reported battery life greater 
                      than the XS and XS Max.</p> 

                      <p>The cellular reception of the iPhone XR is a bit worse in weak signal areas than the iPhone X models,
                       but iPhones have never been able to match the cellular reception quality seen in Android phones. 
                       The battery life of the iPhone XR is awesome and the camera does a great job. 
                       For many people, it is likely one of the best iPhones you can buy today and is more reasonably priced 
                       than the new XS and XS Max.</p>

                     </a>
                       <p>LG continues to release great phones that appreciate over time and in a crowded flagship market,
                        the LG V40 may have a tough time finding its place as well.</p>

                       <p>While Huawei was one of the first major brands to launch a phone with three rear cameras, 
                       LG bumped that up by announcing a phone with five total cameras.
                        Three are found on the back and two are on the front.</p>

                        <p>LG has always stood apart from the others with its second rear camera having a true 
                        wide-angle lens for great landscape and large room photography. 
                        The new LG V40 keeps the wide-angle camera while also adding a telephoto lens 
                         to the standard lens option so you can do just about anything you want, including 
                        snapping once to take three photos, with this new flagship phone.</p>

                        <p>Like the Samsung Galaxy Note 9, the LG V40 ThinQ has everything but the kitchen sink included.
                        It has a 3.5mm headphone jack with Quad-DAC support, triple rear camera setup,
                        dual front-facing camera, wireless charging, IP68 rating, MIL-STD 810G shock 
                        resistant rating, microSD expansion card for inexpensive unlimited storage expansion,
                        a screen that extends nearly the full front with a notch, and incredible audio support
                        with its Boombox speaker system. The 3,300 mAh battery will not get you as far as the
                        top five phones in this list and is one area that keeps me from using it daily over the long term.</p>

                        I've been using one for a few weeks and even though I am not happy with the fingerprint scanner
                         placement it is still a compelling smartphone.</p>

                        <p>The Sony Xperia XZ3 matches up on the spec sheet closely with the Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL with 4GB RAM,
                        64GB internal storage, Android 9 Pie, Qualcomm Snapdragon 845, 3300 mAh battery, 
                        wireless charging, and IP68 dust and water resistance.</p>

                        <p>The Xperia XZ3 has a gorgeous curved design with lovely color options and microSD storage expansion options.
                        The 6-inch OLED screen looks great, especially when viewing video content and experiencing

                        <p>Samsung launched the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus earlier this year.
                         It's an evolution in the Galaxy S line, but one that leads as close to perfection as 
                     you can expect for a smartphone today.</p>

                        <p>Samsung's Infinity Display continues to impress and earns a near perfect score like
                         other Samsung displays on the newest Samsung, Apple, and Google phones. There is 6GB of RAM,
                          the fastest Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 mobile processor, a rear dual aperture camera,
                           another one with super slow motion support (S9 Plus only), the ability to add 
                       inexpensive microSD cards, improved Bixby assitant and a hardware button dedicated to its use,
                        Samsung Pay payment technology, wireless and fast charging, IP68 dust andS
                         water resistance, a USB Type-C standard port, and traditional 3.5mm headset jack. 
                         It also launches with Android 8.0 Oreo. There is nothing missing from the Galaxy S9 
                         Plus and it still deserves respect several months later</p>
